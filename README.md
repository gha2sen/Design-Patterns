# Design-Patterns

This repository is my personal design patterns refresher.
The goal is to revisit key concepts, strengthen understanding, and apply each pattern through hands-on examples.

For every pattern, I follow a consistent workflow:

1. Study → Review the core idea, intent, and real-world use cases.
2. Document → Take notes examples of using the pattern, pros/cons ....
3. Practice → Implement a small problem that demonstrates the pattern in action.
